# Page-Replacement-Algorithms-

This project is designed to test different page replacement algorithms for efficiency. Four page replacement algorithms are simulated: FIFO, LRU, LFU and Random, and all are ran through the main function with the respective flags (-fifo, -lru, -lfu, -ran).

To run: <executable> <flag> <pageTableSize>
